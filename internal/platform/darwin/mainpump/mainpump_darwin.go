// Package mainpump lets a test binary serve the main dispatch queue.
//
// The platform package hops to the main thread with dispatch_sync, which a Go test
// binary never serves: the main thread sits in the testing package, so a test that
// reaches such a call passes or hangs by luck of which thread its goroutine runs on.
// Only test binaries import this package; nothing in an application links it.
